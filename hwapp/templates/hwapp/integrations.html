    IMPORTANT:
</b>
<p>
    Please follow the instructions for integrating external services to this platform. This will add the events from the external calendar(s) to your homework list, and will associate a class for them. Please do NOT edit the class. Homework is imported from the calendar, with the priority being "None."
    You may choose to use the preset options or create your own with the "Other" tab. This will allow you to create custom names for your calendar(s) and their associated homework
